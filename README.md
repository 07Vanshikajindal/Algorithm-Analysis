**Course**: Algorithmic Analysis and Peer Code Review

**Student:** Vanshika Jindal

**Role:** Student A

**Algorithm:** Boyer-Moore Majority Vote

**Language:** Java


**Project Overview**
This project implements and analyzes the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm, designed to find
the majority element (if any) in a given array. It includes metrics tracking (comparisons, iterations,
memory usage), CSV export, CLI testing, and performance visualization.

**Algorithm Details**

**Goal:** Identify an element that appears more than n/2 times in an array.

**Time Complexity:** Best O(n), Average O(n), Worst O(n)

**Space Complexity**: O(1)

Metrics Collected

**Metric Description**

**Comparisons**: Number of value comparisons made
**Iterations**: Loop iterations performed
**Array Accesses**:  Times elements were accessed
**Memory (bytes)**: Memory allocated for the algorithm
**Execution Time (ms)**:  Duration of algorithm execution

**Conclusion**
The Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm is a highly efficient linear-time solution for identifying
majority elements using minimal memory. This project demonstrates clean implementation, testing,
and empirical analysis of algorithmic performance in Java.
